Let's build a digital library application to help us keep track of the books on our wishlist that we want to read!

## Learning Goals

* **Monolithic structure**. Work with a monolith application to become comfortable with app configuration and folder organization.
* **Database-backed application**. Apply Knex migrations and Objection models with a PostgreSQL database for interacting with data.
* **Validating data**. Understand the mportance of defining database and model level validations that are in sync within the application for appropriate error messages.

## Getting Started

From your challenges directory, run the following:

```no-highlight
et get launch-digital-library
cd launch-digital-library
yarn install
```

Next, create your database, then get the app running:

```no-highlight
createdb launch_digital_library_development
yarn run dev
```

You can check `server/src/config/getDatabaseUrl.cjs` to verify that is the correct database name for this application!

Navigating to <http://localhost:3000/books> should display the header `My Book Wishlist`.

## Instructions

This is a multi-part challenge, you should not expect to complete this assignment in one sitting. There will be other lessons you will need to complete in order to gain the knowledge and experience for this challenge.

**Complete each part before moving onto the next!**

Make sure you take a look at the files you are provided with. A couple to highlight:
- `booksRouter.js` has been created and is ready for routes to be added, and `Book.js` has been created with an empty class inside.
- `App.js`, within the folder `client/src/components`, is our top-level React component that displays the current text on the webpage. It includes a React `BrowserRouter`.
- `BooksList.js` includes a fetch call within the `useEffect()` to grab all of the books. For each book, it displays a `BookItem` component.
- `BookItem.js` shows the title and author of a book, and links the user to the show page.
- `BookShow.js` is responsible for displaying all of the book details.
- `BookForm.js` has the new book form, error handling, a custom `handleChange`, and a POST fetch request.

## Core User Stories

Use the user stories and acceptance criteria below to guide you as you build this application. Read through all 3 parts of the user stories to get an idea of how this application will be structured.

- What data types will be used in your migration?
- Which attributes are required or optional?
- What React components will you need to create?
- What routes are needed (front-end and back-end)?

### Part 1: View Your Book Wishlist

```no-highlight
As an avid book reader
I want to see a list of all books
So that I can see which books I want to read
```

Acceptance Criteria:

- I can visit the books index page at `/books`
- On the books index page there is an `h1` header to let me know this is my collection of books, of "My Book Wishlist" 
- There should be a list of all book titles retrieved from the database

Implementation Details:

- You should create a `books` table with a required string of `title`, a required string of `author`, a required integer of `pageCount`, an optional string of `description`, and an optional boolean of `fiction`
- You will need to update the provided `Book` Model to have Objection functionality
- Finally, you will need to build an API endpoint for GET requests to "/api/v1/books" which serves up all books in a format that the `BooksList` component can render to the page
- Be sure to account for any errors that occur in your API endpoint!


```no-highlight
As an avid book reader
I want to view the details of a book
So that I can learn more about the book
```

Acceptance Criteria:

- On the books index page, the title of each book should be a link to that book's show page at the "/books/:id" path
- A book show page should include its title, author, description, page count, and whether or not it is fiction

Implementation Details:

- You will need to create an API endpoint for GET requests to "/api/v1/book/:id" which responds with a single book's data in a format that the `BookShow` component can render to the page

**Tips:**

- The node REPL console has been configured so you can create sample data through the console (add any classes you create to `server/src/models/index.js` so you have access to them!)

### Part 2: Add New Books

```no-highlight
As an avid book reader
I want to add books to my list
So that I can read more books
```

Acceptance Criteria:

- Navigating to `/books/new` should display a form for creating a new book
- When the form is submitted successfully, I should be redirected to the book's index page and see the new book in my list
- When there are errors persisting, I will stay on my page with the form still filled out (but no errors will appear _yet_)

Implementation Details:

- Your form has been set up to send a POST request to "/api/v1/books" upon submission
- Create the corresponding API endpoint to persist the submitted form data to the database

### Part 3: Model Validation

```no-highlight
As an avid book reader
I want to properly validate my books
So that I can persist valid data in the database
```

Acceptance Criteria:

- If the form submission is unsuccessful, I should stay on the same page with the form, and any model-level errors are visible on the screen

Implementation Details:

- The Book model should include `jsonSchema` validations that mirror the constraints defined in the database schema
  - `title` and `author` are both strings and required
  - `pageCount` must be an integer and required
  - `description` is a string with a minimum length of 20 characters (_optional property_)
  - `fiction` is a boolean value (_optional property_)
- Update your POST API endpoint to handle any validation errors, returning a `422 Unprocessable Entity` error if the validation fails
- In the event of any other errors, return a `500 Internal Server Error`
- Remember to clean your user input using the provided `cleanUserInput` service before attempting to persist!

**Tips:**

- For some attributes, you may consider including additional accepted data types
- Check the [JSON Schema][jsonSchemaGuide] documentation for the validation options that are available
- The service helpers for `cleanUserInput` and `translateServerErrors` have been provided for you to use in order to display error messages

## Non-Core User Stories

### Bonus: Add a Uniqueness Validation

- Write a migration to update your `title` column in your `books` table to be unique (do some research on how to alter an existing table!)
- Add a uniqueness model-level validation to your `title` field
- Be sure to have this validation handled in the same way as all other model-level validations!

### Bonus: Cypress Testing

- Write your own Cypress tests for this application
- Within the `e2e` Cypress folder, test files have been created for you to fill in
- Your feature tests should include the Books index page, Book show page, and submitting a new Book
- For more Cypress practice, write feature tests for the Bonus Podcast section!

**Tips:**

- Make sure you first read this week's article `Running Cypress in Monolith Apps` before starting this section
- Reference back to Week 2 articles on how to write Cypress tests
- The [Cypress documentation][cypressDocumentation] has some great tips on writing quality tests!

### Bonus: Podcasts

Along with books, there are also many great podcasts to listen to! In our app, we should include a section dedicated to podcasts.

```no-highlight
As a podcast enthusiast
I want to see a list of podcasts
So that I know which ones I have already saved
```

Acceptance Criteria:

- Visiting `/podcasts` should display a list of all podcast names from the database
- There is a link at the top of the `Podcasts` page to bring the user to the `Books` index page
- In addition, there is a link at the top of the `Books` index page to bring the user to the `Podcasts` index page

```no-highlight
As a podcast enthusiast
I want to see details of a podcast
So that I pick which podcast to listen to
```

Acceptance Criteria:

- The name of each podcast listed on the podcasts index page is a link to its show page
- The podcast show page should display the podcast name, genre, and URL
- All attributes for a podcast are required - take a look at the [JSON Schema][jsonSchemaGuide] documentation to try out validations! For example, validate that the URL format includes the protocol `https://`

**Tips:**

- What routes will be needed?
- What components will be required?
- Use the node REPL console to create podcasts for sample data on your page
